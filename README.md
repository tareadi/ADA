This project focus on patient health, specifically diabetes as a chronic condition. In many cases,
arriving patients to intensive care units do not have validated medical histories. A distressed patient,
especially one who has been brought in disoriented or unresponsive, may be unable to provide
information on chronic diseases including heart disease, traumas, or diabetes. Transferring medical
records might take days, especially if the patient comes from another healthcare professional or
system. So we will be focusing on more on models for determining whether a patient brought to
an ICU has indeed been diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus, a type of diabetic. Participants will
investigate labelled training data for model development using dataset provided on kaggle website[1].
we used unlabeled data to generate the result.
